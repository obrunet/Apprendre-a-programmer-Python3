# Apprendre-a-programmer-Python3
All the book's exercises i've done for learning purposes.

![Master's degree](https://github.com/obrunet/Apprendre-a-programmer-Python3/blob/master/book_frontpage.jpg)

This is a great book in french. A free copy can be found on [the author's website](http://inforef.be/swi/download/apprendre_python3.pdf).

My solutions may differ from the author's ones. All the snippets have been coded using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and its excellent [Python plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).
In each chapter, few exercises aren't corrected. But i've done many of them (see files terminated by "_not_corrected_")

Only chapters 8 and after 13 aren't finished yet because they are specifics to GUI, widgets and network programming (which aren't my priority). This repository will be updated regularly in the next few weeks.
